  Draft and execute git commit commands that follow the Conventional
  Commits spec. Use when asked to write a commit message, prepare
  git commit -m arguments, keep message lines at 72 characters, avoid
  accidental blank paragraphs, or skip Co-authored-by trailers unless
  explicitly requested.

# Conventional Commits

Write commit messages in English and format them for `git commit`.

## When to Use This Skill

- The user asks for a conventional commit message
- The user wants a ready-to-run `git commit` command
- The task needs a short subject plus a wrapped body
- The user wants to avoid unwanted commit trailers

## Required Rules

Follow these rules every time:

1. Use the Conventional Commits format:
   `<type>(<optional-scope>): <subject>`
2. Keep every commit message line at 72 characters or fewer.
3. Write the message in English unless the user explicitly asks for
   another language.
4. Use `git commit -m` to pass the message.
5. Use one `-m` for the subject.
6. Use one additional `-m` for each body paragraph.
7. Never add another `-m` just to wrap a paragraph. Keep wrapped lines
   inside the same quoted argument so Git does not insert a blank line.
8. Rewrite long body text so each message line stays within 72
   characters.
9. Do not open an editor, use a here-doc, or write the message to a
   temporary file.
10. Do not add a `Co-authored-by` trailer unless the user explicitly
    asks for it for that specific commit.

## Workflow

1. Identify the change being committed.
2. Choose the best conventional commit type, such as `feat`, `fix`,
   `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, or `chore`.
3. Write a concise subject that explains the change.
4. If a body is needed, add clear paragraphs that explain why the
   change was made and any important impact.
5. Wrap each paragraph to 72 characters without splitting it across
   multiple `-m` flags.
6. Return a ready-to-run `git commit` command that uses `-m` arguments.
7. Add trailers only when the user explicitly requests them.

## Common Patterns

| Situation | Preferred pattern |
| --- | --- |
| New user-facing behavior | `feat:` |
| Bug fix | `fix:` |
| Documentation only | `docs:` |
| Internal cleanup with no behavior change | `refactor:` |
| Test-only change | `test:` |
| Tooling or dependency updates | `build:` or `chore:` |

## Examples

### Minimal subject only

```bash
git commit -m "docs: add contributing guide"
```

### Feature with body paragraphs

```bash
git commit \
  -m "feat(auth): add refresh token rotation" \
  -m "Rotate refresh tokens after each successful renewal to reduce
replay risk and simplify token revocation tracking."
```

### Fix with one wrapped body paragraph

```bash
git commit \
  -m "fix(api): handle empty search query" \
  -m "Return a validation error when the query string is empty.
This keeps downstream filters from running on invalid input."
```

### Breaking change with explicit body

```bash
git commit \
  -m "refactor(config): rename cache ttl setting" \
  -m "Rename cache.ttlSeconds to cache.ttl to match runtime usage." \
  -m "BREAKING CHANGE: update deployment configs before release."
```

### When the user explicitly asks for a trailer

Only then add it:

```bash
git commit \
  -m "fix(ui): prevent duplicate submit" \
  -m "Disable the submit button while the request is in flight." \
  -m "Co-authored-by: Example User <example@example.com>"
```

## Final Checks

Before presenting the command:

- confirm the commit type matches the change
- confirm each message line is 72 characters or fewer
- confirm the command uses `-m` arguments for multiline messages
- confirm extra `-m` flags only appear for real paragraph breaks
- confirm no `Co-authored-by` trailer appears unless requested
